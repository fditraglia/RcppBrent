# RcppBrent
This package shows how to use the [BRENT C++ library](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/brent/brent.html) inside of an Rcpp package. According to its creator John Burkart: 
> BRENT is a C++ library which contains algorithms for finding zeros or minima of a scalar function of a scalar variable, by Richard Brent.
>
> The methods do not require the use of derivatives, and do not assume that the function is differentiable.
>
> This file includes some revisions suggested and implemented by John Denker. In particular, it is now possible to pass either a plain function or a C++ functor. Also, a "brent" namespace was defined to make it easier to avoid naming conflicts.
